# IDEAS

* Stupid place for me to think of stuff for this.


## ANDROID SUPPORT

* Make it FULLY run via external assets, like maybe have a preloader type thing that extracts the assets? (Path: /storage/emulated/0/Games/GAMENAME)

## PSVita Support

* This is honestly easy as shit.

## Switch Support

* External assets thing like android???
